# rgrep

Toy implementation of a command-line interface program that simulates the basic functionality of `grep` following the concepts presented through [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) up until [Chapter 12](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html). The project focuses on combining knowledge such as code organization, vectors, strings, closures, iterators, handling errors properly, exploring the usage of traits and lifetimes and writing tests, putting those skills in practice and building a somewhat useful tool.
